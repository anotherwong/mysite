# Contacting me

If you want to contact me in any way, such as if you think the blog is so good that you want to reach out to me, here's how.

- **MAIL**
  - You really don't need to know my email, but if you need it it is [**here**](example.com)
- [**Site code**](https://github.com/anotherwong/examplesite) Here's the base code from this site.
- **really nice, custom duotone** syntax highlighting based on [**PrismJS**](https://prismjs.com)
- mobile friendly layout
```
