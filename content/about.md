# Hi there

Hi! I'm a hobbyist, tinkerer, god-awful artist and computer enthusiast who has no idea how they work but gets results. My biggest personality trait is my open presence, but my second biggest is looking confident even if i'm not.

Some of the stuff I have achieved:
- **Head student** I've become the Deputy Head Boy of VSA. This feels really good. REALLY GOOD.
- [**Fira Code**](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) as default monospaced font. It's gorgeous!
- **really nice, custom duotone** syntax highlighting based on [**PrismJS**](https://prismjs.com)
- mobile friendly layout
- Credit for the Terminal theme goes to [**Radek**](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) for the cool theme.

Enjoy!
