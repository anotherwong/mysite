So, I guess this is my little corner of the web. Like a vacation home, I want a place away from the main web that's my own space. I STAKE MY GROUND HERE, AND ON THIS HILL I SHALL DIE! Hehe, I just wanted to say that. Anyway, here. Have a picture of Makoto from Princess Connect. Credit goes to [**タチバナ**](https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/2337346) for the picture- subscribe to them if you have a pixiv account!

> As for hobbies, old electronics and tinkering is kind of my thing. I play around with a lot of electronic junk without really knowing how it works, but hey! It works!

That's about it for now- I'll keep this site updated for a while!

- I'll try my best to tag everything, but if you find I've mistagged things here please contact me on Github!
